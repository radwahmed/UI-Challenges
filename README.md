# Flutter Challenges 🚀

This repository contains three interactive Flutter challenges that demonstrate different concepts:  
- Lists with gestures (Dismissible + Reorderable)  
- Physics-based interactions (Draggable + DragTarget)  
- Advanced animations (AnimationController with Tweens)  

---

## 📌 Challenge 1: Interactive Dismissible Lists

A **task management widget** where users can:
- Swipe to delete tasks (`Dismissible`).
- Drag to reorder (`ReorderableListView`).
- Confirm before deletion (Dialog).
- Undo deletion (`SnackBar`).
- Includes **3 sample tasks**.

## 📌 Challenge 2: Interactive Physics Widget

A **mini physics simulation** using `Draggable` and `DragTarget`:
- Drag colored balls into their matching containers.
- Provides **visual feedback** while dragging.
- Shows **success state** for correct matches.
- Handles incorrect drops gracefully.

## 📌 Challenge 3: Advanced Animation Chain

A **loading animation widget** using `AnimationController`:
- Animates **3 dots** that scale and fade sequentially.
- Uses multiple **Tween animations**.
- Runs in a **continuous loop**.
- Uses **smooth curves** for natural motion.
